## Note that we strive for a relatively simple approach. If necessary, it can be made more sophisticated

##
## makeCacheMatrix is a function that will create the inverse matrix object
## of a given input matrix object. 
##
## This inverse matrix object will be cached, so that it can be retrieved
## efficiently without the need of computing it over and over again, which
## would be very costly. 
##

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


##
## cacheSolve is a function that will return the inverse matrix
## of a given input matrix.
##
## If the inverse matrix has been computed before, a cached
## version of it will be returned.
##
## If the inverse matrix has not been computed before, it will
## be computed on the fly and it will be added to the cache.
##

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
